I found that with latest windows updates tool does not work as expected.

If this is your case, you can try downloading  VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll  from here  --->
    
    https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor/tree/master/x64/Release
    

Instruction:
1. download dll from the link above 
2. exit from virtual-desktop-enhancer tool
3. Delete old virtual-desktop-accessor.dll from libraries/ folder 
4. copy downloaded file there 
5. start VDE too
6. Enjoy


for repair hing thanks and credits to Konstantin Kushnir
